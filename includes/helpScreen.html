    <h3>Questionnaire editor</h3>


    <p>This app will build a questionnaire from an internal model. It has the following parts</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The fundamental part is the DataGroup (DG). A hierarchical set of elements that describes some entity
            of value - such as a Patient or a Specimen. Each element has a datatype as well as numerous other
            attributes such as name, description and cardinality. </li>
        <li>The DG datatype can either be a FHIR datatype or another DG - in other words a DG can contain other DGs.
            This allows complex DGs to be constructed from simpler ones.</li>
        <li>The DG can be converted into a Questionnaire - each DG defines a single Questionnaire.</li>
    </ul>
